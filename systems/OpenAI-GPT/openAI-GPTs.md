# OpenAI's GPT models

We evaluate the following models:
- GPT-4o ("gpt-4o-2024-08-06"),
- GPT-3.5-Turbo ("gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"),
- GPT-4o-mini ("gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18")
- GPT-5 ("gpt-5-2025-08-07")
- GPT-5-nano ("gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07")
- GPT-5-mini ("gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07")

We use the following prompt:
```python
		completion = client.chat.completions.create(model=gpt_model,
		response_format= {"type": "json_object"},
		messages= [
		{
			"role": "user",
			"content": f"""
			### Task
			Your task is to classify the following text according to genre. Genres are text types, defined by the function of the text, authorâ€™s purpose and form of the text. Always provide a label, even if you are not sure.

			### Output format
				Return a valid JSON dictionary with the following key: 'genre' and a value should be an integer which represents one of the labels according to the following dictionary: {label_dict_with_description_ext}.

				
				Text: '{text}'

The evaluation of the 3.5, 4o and 4o-mini models on the X-GINCO and EN-GINCO dataset cost 3.27$.
