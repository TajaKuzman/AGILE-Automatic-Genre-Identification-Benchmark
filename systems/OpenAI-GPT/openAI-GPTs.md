# OpenAI's GPT models

We evaluate the following models:
- GPT-4o ("gpt-4o-2024-08-06"),
- GPT-3.5-Turbo ("gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"),
- GPT-4o-mini ("gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18")

We use the following prompt:
```json
			messages= [
			{
				"role": "user",
				"content": f"""
				### Task
				Your task is to classify the following text according to genre. Genres are text types, defined by the function of the text, authorâ€™s purpose and form of the text. Always provide a label, even if you are not sure.

				### Output format
					Return a valid JSON dictionary with the following key: 'genre' and a value should be an integer which represents one of the labels according to the following dictionary: {labels_dict}.

					
					Text: '{text}'
			"""
				}
```

The evaluation of the three models on the X-GINCO and EN-GINCO dataset cost 3.27$.
