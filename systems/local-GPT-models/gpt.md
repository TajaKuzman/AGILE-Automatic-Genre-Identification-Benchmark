# Evaluation of local GPT models

The following GPT models were installed locally and ran through the [Ollama API service](https://ollama.com/). We used the quantized models as provided through the [Ollama library](https://ollama.com/library/).

The following models were evaluated:
- [Gemma 3 (27B model)](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3) `gemma3:27b`
- [Gemma 2 (27B model)](https://ollama.com/library/gemma2) `gemma2:27b`
- [DeepSeek-R1 (14B model)](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1) `deepseek-r1:14b`
- [Llama 3.3 model (70B model)](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.3) `llama3.3:latest`
- [GaMS-Instruct model (9B model)](https://huggingface.co/cjvt/GaMS-9B-Instruct) `GaMS-9B-Instruct:latest`

The prompt:
```python

	labels_dict = {
		0: "Other",
		1: "Information/Explanation",
		2: "News",
		3: "Instruction",
		4: "Opinion/Argumentation",
		5: "Forum",
		6: "Prose/Lyrical",
		7: "Legal",
		8: "Promotion"
	}

	for text in texts:
		current_prompt = f"""
				### Task
				Your task is to classify the following text according to genre. Genres are text types, defined by the function of the text, authorâ€™s purpose and form of the text. Always provide a label, even if you are not sure.

				### Output format
					Return a valid JSON dictionary with the following key: 'genre' and a value should be an integer which represents one of the labels according to the following dictionary: {labels_dict}.

					
					Text: '{text}'
			"""

```

In some (rare) cases, the models' output was invalid, e.g. `{"genre": -1}`, `{ "genre": 13 }`. These cases were manually changed to `Mix`, a label used with the X-GENRE and CORE classifiers when the prediction confidence is low.
